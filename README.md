# code refactor

## html code update

I linked the style sheet in the head tag.

I changed all div tags to semantic tags. I added header, figure, nav, article, aside, and footer.

I added image alts for all images trying to keep in mind anyone with a disability with image descriptions matching the content of the page. I tried to keep them concise, yet descriptive enough to convey the message of the image.

There was one 'class' that had to be changed to 'id' to make the link at the top work.

> Organizing the code to feature semantic tags makes it much easier to picture the layout and organize the flow. Non-specific tags, though doing the same function, make it much more difficult to understand what I'm looking at. Finding something quicker saves a lot of time.

## css code update

I had to make the css match the html tags. I recall only changing header and nav lines.
